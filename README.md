# 3D Renderer in OpenGL and C++

## Overview
This project is my attempt at creating a 3D renderer from scratch using OpenGL and C++. 
The goal is to build a foundational understanding of rendering techniques, graphics pipelines, and shaders. Well, I wanted to try my hand at graphics programming :")


## Project Goals
- **Learn OpenGL**: Understand and implement the core concepts of OpenGL for real-time 3D rendering.
- **Explore Graphics Programming**: Gain insight into shaders, lighting models, and the overall graphics pipeline.
- **Optimization**: Experiment with performance optimization techniques for real-time rendering.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **C++ Compiler**: Make sure you have a C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later.
- **OpenGL**: Requires OpenGL 3.3 or higher. Ensure your systemâ€™s graphics drivers are up-to-date.
- **GLFW**: Used for window management and handling input.
- **GLAD**: OpenGL loader library to handle function pointers for OpenGL.
